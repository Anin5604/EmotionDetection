# EmotionDetection

A basic Emotion Detection system built in Python that classifies the emotion expressed in text inputs.

## 🧠 Overview

This project demonstrates a foundational NLP-based emotion classification model:
- Text data is preprocessed and vectorized.
- A TensorFlow-based neural network model is trained to classify emotions.
- The model predicts emotion categories (e.g., happy, sad, angry, neutral).

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow (basics)
- NLP preprocessing (tokenization, padding)
- Streamlit (for simple deployment)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
   `git clone https://github.com/Anin5604/EmotionDetection.git`

2. Install dependencies  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run the model training script  
   `python train.py`

4. Launch the app (if deployed)  
   `streamlit run app.py`
